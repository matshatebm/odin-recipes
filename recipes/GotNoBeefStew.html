<h1>Got No Beef Stew</h1>
<img src="../pictures/Got No Beef Stew.webp">
<p>Got no beef? That's ok, because I am going to show you how to make something<br>
     that looks like beef stew, eats like beef stew, and kinda sorta tastes like<br>
      beef stew without having to use any beef. And whether you're making this because<br>
       beef is just too expensive, or you are trying to cut down on the amount of beef <br>
       you eat, or you just enjoy bad grammar â€“ no matter the reason, I really do think<br>
        you're going to enjoy this! Serve with buttered bread.</p>
