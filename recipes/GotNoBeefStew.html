<h1>Got No Beef Stew</h1>
<img src="../pictures/Got No Beef Stew.webp">
<p>Got no beef? That's ok, because I am going to show you how to make something<br>
     that looks like beef stew, eats like beef stew, and kinda sorta tastes like<br>
      beef stew without having to use any beef. And whether you're making this because<br>
       beef is just too expensive, or you are trying to cut down on the amount of beef <br>
       you eat, or you just enjoy bad grammar â€“ no matter the reason, I really do think<br>
        you're going to enjoy this! Serve with buttered bread.</p>

        

<ol>
    <li>Combine butter and vegetable oil in a pot over medium-high heat and allow butter to melt.<br>
         Toss in mushrooms and season salt. Cook, stirring occasionally until mushrooms are nicely<br>
          browned, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>

    <li>Add onions and lower heat to medium. Cook, stirring, until onions have softened and are<br>
         translucent and the bottom of the pot has turned brown, about 5 minutes. The browned bits<br>
          on the bottom of the pot will add flavor and color. Add tomato paste and flour to thicken <br>
          the stew. Cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>

    <li>Pour in water, increase temperature to high, and bring to a simmer. While you're waiting for <br>
        stew to come to a simmer, mix in miso paste, beef paste, bay leaf, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder,<br>
         black pepper, thyme, rosemary, and cayenne; stir to combine.</li>

    <li>Once stew is bubbling, add carrots, and celery and reduce heat to medium-low to keep stew at a steady simmer,<br>
         stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Taste and season with salt if necessary. Add potatoes and simmer until<br>
          potatoes are very tender and creamy inside and stew has reduced and thickened, about 30 more minutes.<br>
           Potatoes can be stirred in and broken up a bit to make the stew thicker.</li>

    <li>Turn off the heat and stir in freshly chopped Italian parsley if desired.</li>
